Feature: Source Control Management - Pulling and pushing applications
  Background:
    When Open Source Control Management Page
    Then Delete the repo config
    Then Initialize the repository config

  @SOURCE_CONTROL_MANAGEMENT_TEST
  Scenario: Should successfully push a pipeline to git from pipeline list page
    When Deploy and test pipeline "test_pipeline2_fll_airport" with pipeline JSON file "fll_airport_pipeline2.json"
    Then Click push button in Actions dropdown
    Then Commit changes with message "upload pipeline to Git"
    Then Banner is shown with message "Successfully pushed pipeline test_pipeline2_fll_airport"
    Then Clean up pipeline "test_pipeline2_fll_airport" which is created for testing

  @SOURCE_CONTROL_MANAGEMENT_TEST
  Scenario: Should successfully push and pull multiple pipelines to git from sync page
    # Setup
    When Deploy and test pipeline "test_multi_push_fll_airport" with pipeline JSON file "fll_airport_pipeline2.json"
    When Deploy and test pipeline "test_multi_push_logs_generator" with pipeline JSON file "logs_generator.json"
    When Deploy and test pipeline "synced_logs_generator" with pipeline JSON file "logs_generator.json"
    Then Click push button in Actions dropdown
    Then Commit changes with message "upload pipeline to Git"
    Then Banner is shown with message "Successfully pushed pipeline synced_logs_generator"

    # Push 2 pipelines in bulk
    When Open Source Control Sync Page
    When Select local pipeline "test_multi_push_fll_airport"
    When Select local pipeline "test_multi_push_logs_generator"
    When Push selected pipelines to remote with commit message "upload pipelines to git"

    # Verify that when one operation is running, another operation can not be started
    Then Verify "push" operation is running
    Then Verify the remote "push" button is disabled
    When Select remote pipelines tab
    Then Verify "push" operation is running
    Then Verify the remote "pull" button is disabled

    # Move to another page and back, the operation should be running
    When Open CDAP main page
    When Open Source Control Sync Page
    Then Verify "push" operation is running
    Then Verify the remote "push" button is disabled

    # The push operation should succeed
    Then Wait for "push" operation to complete successfully
    When Select remote pipelines tab
    Then Verify "test_multi_push_fll_airport" pipeline exist in list
    Then Verify "test_multi_push_logs_generator" pipeline exist in list

    # Delete these pipelines locally
    Then Clean up pipeline "test_multi_push_fll_airport" which is created for testing
    Then Clean up pipeline "test_multi_push_logs_generator" which is created for testing

    # Then pull these from remote
    When Open Source Control Sync Page
    When Select remote pipelines tab
    When Select remote pipeline "test_multi_push_fll_airport"
    When Select remote pipeline "test_multi_push_logs_generator"
    When Pull selected pipelines

    # Verify that when one operation is running, another operation can not be started
    Then Verify "pull" operation is running
    Then Verify the remote "pull" button is disabled
    When Select local pipelines tab
    Then Verify "pull" operation is running
    Then Verify the remote "push" button is disabled
    When Select remote pipelines tab

    # The pull operation should succeed
    Then Wait for "pull" operation to complete successfully
    When Select local pipelines tab
    Then Verify "test_multi_push_fll_airport" pipeline exist in local list
    Then Verify "test_multi_push_logs_generator" pipeline exist in local list
    When Open pipeline list page
    Then Verify pipeline "test_multi_push_fll_airport" is deployed
    Then Verify pipeline "test_multi_push_logs_generator" is deployed

    # Cleanup
    Then Clean up pipeline "test_multi_push_fll_airport" which is created for testing
    And Clean up pipeline "test_multi_push_logs_generator" which is created for testing
    And Clean up pipeline "synced_logs_generator" which is created for testing

  @SOURCE_CONTROL_MANAGEMENT_TEST
  Scenario: Remote pipeline tab loads pipelines from git
    # Setup
    When Deploy and test pipeline "test_pipeline2_fll_airport" with pipeline JSON file "fll_airport_pipeline2.json"
    # Test push from SCM sync page
    When Open Source Control Sync Page
    When Select "test_pipeline2_fll_airport" pipeline and push
    Then Commit changes with message "upload pipeline to Git"
    Then Verify "push" operation is running
    Then Wait for "push" operation to complete successfully
    When Select remote pipelines tab
    Then Verify pipeline list size 1
    Then Verify "test_pipeline2_fll_airport" pipeline exist in list
    # Test pull from SCM sync page
    Then Clean up pipeline "test_pipeline2_fll_airport" which is created for testing
    When Open Source Control Sync Page

    # Clean up
    Then Clean up pipeline "test_pipeline2_fll_airport" which is created for testing

  @PIPELINE_EDIT_TEST
  @SOURCE_CONTROL_MANAGEMENT_TEST
  Scenario: Edit a simple pipeline and restore a version from git
    When Deploy and test pipeline "pipeline_edit_test" with pipeline JSON file "logs_generator.json"
    # Push version 1 of the pipeline to git.
    Then Click push button in Actions dropdown
    Then Commit changes with message "upload pipeline to Git"
    Then Banner is shown with message "Successfully pushed pipeline pipeline_edit_test"
    # Edit the pipeline to create a new LCM version.
    Then Edit pipeline and verify changes
    # Pull version 1 back from git.
    Then Click pull button in Actions dropdown
    Then Pipeline source node "referenceName" property should be "logs_data_source"
    Then History should show 3 entries
